# Grocery-Expenses-Analysis

For this project, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to track and analyze my grocery store expenses.
It uses CSV files as a live data source, which are collected and cleaned using a custom Python application.
The dashboard provides insights into total spending, the distribution of expenses across different stores, and spending by product categories.

For more information about the data collection, handling, cleaning, and analysis — as well as the custom Python tool — please refer to the documentation file.
